        <h2>BallGobbler Bot</h2>
          BallGobbler is a virtual robot built in the Unity game engine that competed in a bot tournament. 
        <br>
          Using GAIL and Behavioural Cloning, BallGobbler was trained to capture objectives and bring them back to base while avoiding attacks 
          from opposint bots. TensorFlow and Sci-Kit Learn were used to implement reinforcement learning and assign rewards to aid training.
        
        <p>
          <h2><a href="https://github.com/ImaadJ10/Spotify_Collage">Spotify Collage</a></h2>
        
          This web application allows users to monitor their Spotify listening habits and discover new music and playlists they might like. 
          <br>
          Spotify Collage's backend is built in Python using the Flask framework, with recommendations being pulled directly from the Spotify 
          API using a wrapper called Spotipy. The website was hosted on Google Cloud Platform for ease of scalability.
          

        <p>
          <h2><a href="https://github.com/keshavg45/Solari-HackOR">Solari</a></h2>
       
          Solari is a job application portal that allows recruiters can post job listings for their company. Volunteers can then 
          view and filter through job listings based on metrics like roles, location, or the tags associated with the posting. 
        <br>
          Solari's backend is built on Java, while the frontend was made using the JavaFX framework. All data, including information about 
          job postings and information about volunteers and recruiters is stored on a SQLite server that interfaces with the application using
          the JDBC library. 
        </p>

          <h2><a href="https://github.com/yajasmalhotra/TAsker">(TA)sker</a></h2>
                
          Tasker is a course management tool that allows administrative staff at schools and universities to create new courses
          or manage existing ones. 
        <br>
          Tasker is built on Java, while the frontend was created using the Java Swing GUI framework. Schedules created using the application
          are converted to and stored as JSON files, which can be loaded up on any instance of the application. 
      
        </p>

        <p>
          <h2><a href="https://github.com/yajasmalhotra/Tracker-50">Tracker 50</a></h2>    
    
          Tracker 50 is a simple online flight tracking interface that allows users to find the status of any flight, created as the final
          project for Harvard's CS50x.
        <br>
          Tracker 50 is written in Python. The frontend is created using the Flask framework in conjunction with the Jinja2 templating engine. User
          data, i.e. usernames and passwords are stored on a SQLite database. Flight data is pulled using the free tier of the AviationStack REST API.
